My personal website, built with Next.js and Framer Motion.

## Getting Started

First install dependencies using

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
