# What is Gatsby?
Gatsby.js is one of the most popular tools for building websites and apps today. It is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) powered static site generator that enables you to build interactive components right into your static website. 

# Getting Started
Let's get started! To start, you'll need the following tools:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/)
- [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other IDE)

First, you'll need to have the Gatsby CLI installed, which will take care of setting up your project for you. 

``` js
var name = "World";
```
